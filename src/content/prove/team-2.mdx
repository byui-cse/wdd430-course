## Overview
This activity will review the tools introduced last week, and begin the process of making our application scalable by adding dynamically generated product detail pages, and more organization using ESModules.

## Instructions
Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code. Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.

There are many spots where code examples have been given. To get the most out of this activity, do not look at the examples until your group has given that section a try. Then after you look at the example, resist the temptation to copy/paste. Use the examples to get correction, or help you get unstuck...do not just use them to get it done.

## Core Requirements

### **01** Begin

The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for the project. Add each of the attending team members to the "Team2: Dynamic product detail pages" task...then move it to 'Doing'. Read the details of the card together.  
  
The driver should make sure to `pull` any changes from GitHub before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch called `initials--team2`. So if the driver's name were John Doe the branch should be called `jd--team2`.

### **02** Plan

We currently have one HTML file for each product we offer. This works okay when there are only 4 products, but we have plans to expand our inventory. We cannot continue with this model. The product pages all follow a similar template. There should be one HTML file that loads the details about the requested product through JavaScript.

Additionally as our code becomes more complex we will be well served by organizing it using ESModules.

   - Our goal will be to eventually have a one to one relationship with views/pages and modules. Then any functionality that needs to be shared between modules can be placed in a utility module.
   - We will begin now by creating a module (`js/productDetails.mts`) to contain the code we will need to dynamically produce our product detail pages.
   - It's very likely that other parts of our application will need to make requests for product data. That functionality has already been exposed in the `productData.mts` module.
   - There will likely be other functionality that needs to be shared between parts of the application, you should notice that there is already a `utils.mts` module to hold those.

### **03** product_pages/index.html

Instead of having an HTML file per product like we do currently, for scalability we would like one HTML file for all products that has some JavaScript in it to load the details. We need to create this HTML file. Open one of your current product pages in the editor, and `file->Save As-> /product_pages/index.html`

We also need to make some changes to the new file. We are going to dynamically insert the markup to display a product with Javascript so we need to remove the existing markup. We should however use that existing markup as a template, so instead of deleting it first remove all of the product specific information, and then copy it. You should leave the `<section>` element, we will need something to insert our dynamic markup into. It should look something like below:

```html
<h3 id="productName"></h3>
<h2 class="divider" id="productNameWithoutBrand"></h2>
<img id="productImage" class="divider" src="" alt="" />
<p class="product-card__price" id="productFinalPrice"></p>
<p class="product__color" id="productColorName"></p>
<p class="product__description" id="productDescriptionHtmlSimple"></p>
<div class="product-detail__add">
    <button id="addToCart" data-id="">Add to Cart</button>
</div>
```

> ### IMPORTANT!
>             
> Make sure that you are working in the `src` directory and NOT the `dist` directory! The build directory will get erased and completely rebuilt each time you run `npm run build`. Think of `dist` as the production version of your code. `src` is your working directory. You should not need to run `npm run build` very often...like once a week after you have merged some branches.
>
> When you run `npm run start` it will use the files in `src`.

### **04** Review `productData.mts`
  
Open up the `productData.mts` module file. Note a few things:

{/* // import Dialog from '../../components/Dialog.astro' */}

{/* // <Dialog class = "dialog1">
// <h3>Dialog</h3>
// <p>Some stuff</p>
// </Dialog> */}

import Details from '../../components/Details.astro'

<Details summary="Click for example code (productData.mts)">
 
```javascript
function convertToJson(res:Response) {
  if (res.ok) {
    return res.json();
  } else {
    throw new Error("Bad Response");
  }
}

export function getData(category = "tents") {
  return fetch(`../json/${category}.json`)
    .then(convertToJson)
    .then((data) => data);
}

export async function findProductById(id:string) {
  const products = await getData();
  return products.find((item:Product) => item.Id === id);
}

```
</Details>

  1. Right now this module is quite small. Sometimes we will need to get a list of all the data, sometimes we will only need the data for one product. Keeping those functions separate lets us only bring in what we need when we need it. Note that the `convertToJson` function is NOT exported. We really don't have a need to run that outside of the module/file.
  2. We will eventually want to use these functions for more than just tents. We can do that by passing in the name of the category of products we want to pull from into the `getData` function. Note that it defaults to `tents`, so if we pass in nothing when we use it, we will automatically get tents.
  3. Notice on `findProductById` the argument is written like this: `id:string`. This is Typescript. The project uses it and you will be expected to use it in additions as well. 
  4. Notice the `getData()` function compared to the `findProductById()` function. One uses just promises and `.then()`, the other uses [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function). Many find the async/await syntax to be easier to read (and write) than the typical `.then()` based promise handling.
  5. If the syntax on line 13 `(data) => data` is confusing you may want to spend more time reading about arrow functions in JavaScript. You could re-write that short callback function like this using a more traditional anonymous function declaration:

    ```javascript
    function(data) { return data; }
    ```

  6. The callback on line 18 is similar...`(item:Product) => item.Id === id`. Another way to write that could be:

    ```javascript
    function(item:Product) { return item.Id === id; }
    ```

    It is very common to see short functions that just return some value or expression written using the arrow function syntax.

  7. If you open up the `product.ts` file you will see how the `productData.mts` module is used. First note that we have to import the function we need, then we can use that function just like if it were declared locally in that file.

    >Remember that to use ESModules in JavaScript we have to tell the browser we want to use modules...we do that with `type="module"` in the script tag in the HTML. If you look at any of the HTML files in the `product-pages` directory you will see that this has already been added.


### **05** URL Parameters

  We need to have some way of passing in the product that we want to show the details for. A common way to do this is through a [URL Parameter](https://www.sitepoint.com/get-url-parameters-with-javascript/). If we create a link like this: `<a href="product_pages/index.html?product=880RR">`, we have embedded the id of one of our products into the link. When the page loads it will have access to that information. If you read through that article it suggests the following lines of code to retrieve it:

```javascript
const queryString = window.location.search;
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString);
const value = urlParams.get('product')
```

Use those lines to create a new function in the utils.mts file called `getParam(param)` that we can use to get a parameter from the URL when we need to. (Don't forget to return the value!). Why are we passing in `param`? We might not always be looking for a URL parameter called `product`, so we need to be able to pass in any parameter name.

>When you create that function you will need to specify a type for the argument: `param`. What type of data will be be passing in?

Import your new function into `product.ts` and use it to retrieve the URL param "product". Store the value in a variable for later use. Open `/index.html` (remember that a leading slash indicates a root path...the one in `src` in this case) and change the link to the first product page from: `href="product_pages/marmot-ajax-3.html"` to `href="product_pages/index.html?product=880RR"`

> Where did the 880RR come from? If you look in the json/tents.json file you will see that each record in there has an id. 880RR is the id for the first tent!

Then test your getParams function in product.ts to see if you can get the product id successfully when someone navigates to the product-details page. You could set a breakpoint in your code and inspect, or you could use a `console.log`. This would be a good time to test out our findProductById method as well. You will need to visit the first product page (Marmot Ajax) to see the logged value.

You should also update the rest of the links in `/index.html` to match the first one. You can look up the IDs in the tents.json file.

<Details summary="Click for example code (product.ts)">

 ```javascript import { findProductById } from "./productData.mts"; 
import { setLocalStorage, getParam } from './utils.mts';
const productId = getParam('product');

console.log(findProductById(productId));
```
</Details>

### **06** productDetails.mts

If you didn't do it earlier, create a new file in the js folder called `productDetails.mts`.

The `productDetails.mts` module will be responsible for all of the functionality needed to lookup data for a specific product and display it in HTML. Good modules often follow a "black box" philosophy. The module should be very upfront about what it needs to function, but very opaque about the details of how it accomplishes its work. This means in part that we should only expose as much as we need to for it to work. The following functions are recommended:

1. `productDetails(productId, selector)`: there are a few things that need to happen before our module can be used. This function will become the entrypoint into our module and will make sure that everything happens in the right order. This function should be the default export.
2. `addProductToCart()`: This is the function that is currently in product.ts. We need to move it here.
3. `productDetailsTemplate(product)`: this will insert the product specifics into a string of markup.
4. You will also need somewhere to store the product data that we will look up. You can just declare a variable in the module file for this.

To use our module we need to pull everything from the last few steps together in the product.ts file. Once we get everything refactored that file should look something like this:

```javascript
import { getParam } from "./utils.mts";
import productDetails from "./productDetails.mts";

const productId = getParam("product");
productDetails(productId, ".product-detail");
```

Notice we import in the code we need from our modules. Then we get the id of our product using our helper function `getParam`. Then we use the function from productDetails with the productId to finish setting everything up.

### **07**  Check Your Build

We just made some changes to the structure of our site. You probably don't realize it yet, but those changes actually broke the production version of the site. Let's take a look.

We can check the production build locally. If you run npm run build it will update the files in the dist directory. You should do this periodically to check to make sure nothing is broken!

Before moving on go ahead and execute `npm run build`. We can get Vite to preview that build directory as well by using another command in our package.json file. Ensure the following line is also in the scripts section: `"preview": "vite preview",` (add it if it is not there), then run it. Check to see what still works and what is broken. (You always need to execute `npm run build` before you execute `npm run preview` after you have made any changes.)

When we made the changes to the product details page, we forgot to update Vite so that it knew about the changes. Let's do that now.

Open up the vite.config.js file. Note the section that looks like this:

```javascript
build: {
    outDir: '../dist',
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        main: resolve('src/index.html'),
        cart: resolve('src/cart/index.html'),
        checkout: resolve('src/checkout/index.html'),
        product1: resolve('src/product_pages/cedar-ridge-rimrock-2.html'),
        product2: resolve('src/product_pages/marmot-ajax-3.html'),
        product3: resolve('src/product_pages/northface-alpine-3.html'),
        product4: resolve('src/product_pages/northface-talus-4.html'),
      },
    },
  },
```

We aren't using the specific product pages anymore, and instead have an index.html file that we need to let our bundler know about. Change that section so that it looks like this instead:     

```javascript
build: {
    outDir: '../dist',
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        main: resolve('src/index.html'),
        cart: resolve('src/cart/index.html'),
        checkout: resolve('src/checkout/index.html'),
        product1: resolve('src/product_pages/index.html'),
        
      },
    },
  },
```

Anytime we add or remove more .HTML files to the site we will need to update this config or the production version of our site will break!

We need to make one more build tool related change. If you look inside of the `dist` directory...you will notice that the .json files from the json folder are not there! Vite doesn't know it needs to copy them over. That means that on production the Product details page will not work since it relies on that file to look up the product information.

The easiest way to fix this would be to move the `json` directory into the `public` directory. Vite will automatically copy everything in the `public` folder over to the build. If you do not have a `public` directory create one.

You should move the `images` directory into the `public` directory as well, if it is not already there.

Someone on the team should check the build periodically to make sure it is not broken. A good time to do this would be each time a pull request is merged!

## Stretch Goals

### **01** Finish it up!

Complete this activity by writing the rest of the code to display our product. Make sure to pay attention to your Types as you go.

- `productDetailsTemplate(product)`: The markup you need can be found in step 3. Grab that code and put it into a template literal string, e.g.:
```javascript
function productDetailsTemplate(product) {
    return `<p>${product.Name}</p>`;
}
```
- `addProductToCart()`: Move the code from `product.ts` for this function and make any changes necessary to make it work.
- `productDetails()`: This function needs to do a few things. Copy/paste the following into your code to use as a guide for finishing it:
```javascript
export default async function productDetails(productId, selector) {
  // use findProductById to get the details for the current product. findProductById will return a promise! use await or .then() to process it
  // once we have the product details we can render out the HTML
  // add a listener to Add to Cart button
}
```

## Instructor's Solution

As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.

Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.

After working with your team for the one hour activity, [click here for the instructor's solution](https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutsideClient/tree/team-02).

## Make a pull request.

After you have completed what you can, reviewed the instructor's solution, and gotten your code working, the driver should commit and push their changes (don't forget to lint and format your code before committing!), then submit a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally, someone should move the Trello card to "Done".

## Submission

When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before submitting the assessment.
