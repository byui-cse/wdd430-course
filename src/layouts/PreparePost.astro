    <p>
      As you begin with this first preparation activity for the course, it is
      crucial that you understand the importance of preparation. Do not treat
      these activities as a task to check off in as little time as possible.
      Instead always treat them as opportunities to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the semester your instructor will assume that you know and
      understand the concepts from the Prepare activities...<em
        >unless you tell them differently!</em
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      The other activities and discussions will be designed to move beyond the
      readings...give examples and use cases, talk about potential problems,
      etc. Because of this, it is extremely important that you ask for
      clarification on parts of the readings that didn't make sense. Your
      instructor is happy to talk about them...but will assume everything is
      good unless you ask.
