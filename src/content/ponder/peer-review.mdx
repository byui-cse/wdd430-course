## Introduction

Throughout this course you have been working in teams to build a web application. In order to ensure that everyone is contributing and learning, we will be doing a peer review of each team member's contributions to the project. This will help us to identify areas where we can improve as developers and as team members.

## Submission Tool

Use the protected peer review tool at [/peer-review](/peer-review).

- Create your team once with all member names.
- Each student submits one review and includes their own name as the reviewer.
- The team report page shows the averaged scores and grade modifiers.

## Peer Evaluation & Contribution Rubric

Evaluator: [Student Name]

Teammate Being Evaluated: [Teammate Name]

1. Technical Contribution (The "Hard" Skills): Rate the teammate on a scale of 1–5 (1: Poor, 5: Exceptional)
    * Code Quality: Did they write clean, typed, and tested code? Did they follow the team's established architectural patterns? [ ]
    * Version Control Habits: Did they commit frequently with clear messages? Did they participate in meaningful Peer Code Reviews? [ ]
    * Technical Problem Solving: Did they contribute to solving "blockers" or did they wait for others to fix bugs? [ ]
2. Professionalism & Collaboration (The "Soft" Skills): Rate the teammate on a scale of 1–5
    * Reliability: Did they meet internal sprint deadlines? Was their work "finished" when they said it was? [ ]
    * Communication: Did they keep the team updated on their progress (via Slack/Discord/Standups)? Did they ask for help when stuck? [ ]
    * Teamwork: Did they participate in team discussions and code reviews? Did they help others when they were stuck? [ ]

### Qualitative Feedback (Short Answer)

1. The "Bus Factor": If this person were hit by a bus tomorrow, how much of the project would be lost? (i.e., Did they document their work and share knowledge?)
2. Specific Example: Give one example of a time this person helped the team overcome a technical hurdle.
3. Constructive Advice: If you were this person’s Lead Engineer, what is one technical area they should focus on improving?

### The "Multiplier" Calculation

Your peer review will be averaged and converted into a "grade multiplier" that will be applied to your final grade for the course. This is designed to reward those who contribute meaningfully to their teams and to encourage everyone to be active participants in the project. The exact multipliers are as follows:

| Average Peer Score | Grade Modifier | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4.5 – 5.0 | 1.05x (Bonus) | Leadership; the student elevated the team’s output. |
| 3.5 – 4.4 | 1.0x | Solid contributor; met all expectations. |
| 2.5 – 3.4 | 0.85x | Minor friction; missed some deadlines or required heavy hand-holding. |
| Below 2.5 | 0.70x | Significant burden; failed to contribute meaningful code or communication. |

When you are ready to submit your peer review, go to the protected peer review tool at [/peer-review](/peer-review) and fill out the form with your evaluations and feedback. Make sure to submit your review by the deadline.
