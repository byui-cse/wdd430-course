## Overview

Now that you have put together a detailed specification for a project idea it's time to start building! In this first bakeoff you will implement the core features of your project using one of the technology stacks that you have researched so far. The goal of this bakeoff is to get a working prototype of your application up and running so that you can start testing and iterating on it.

## Objectives

- Explore Full stack technologies
- Learn how to measure and compare different technology stacks
- Build a working prototype of your project idea


## Technical Requirements

For this bakeoff we will explore what are currently being called "Meta Frameworks" (SSR/Hybrid Full-stack). These are frameworks that provide a full stack solution for building web applications. Some examples of these include:
- Next.js
- TanStack
- Remix
- SvelteKit
- Nuxt.js
- SolidKit
- Astro (when used with server-side rendering)

Your database can be anything you are comfortable with. You can use a traditional SQL database like PostgreSQL, MySQL or Supabase, or you can use a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Firebase. You can also use an in-memory database like Redis if that fits your project needs.

## Minimum Features & Functionality

Our goal is to build a minimum viable product (MVP) or prototype that includes the core features of your project idea. At a minimum your application should include:
- User authentication (sign up, log in, log out)
- A main feature that is the core of your project idea (e.g., posting content, commenting, liking, etc.)
- A responsive user interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Basic error handling and validation


## **01** Research

For the first bakeoff we will explore a server side rendering (SSR) architecture through a hybrid/meta framework. Pick a framework that you are interested in exploring. Find a tutorial or guide that will help you get started with building a simple application using that framework. 

## **02** Make a Branch

You will want to create a new branch in your git repository for this bakeoff from main. (If you didn't create a repository yet, do that first and make sure your specification file is included.) This will help you to keep your work organized and separate from the main branch. You can name the branch something like `bakeoff-1` or `meta-framework-bakeoff`. 

## **03** AI Generation

We only have two weeks to complete this bakeoff so it's important to have a clear plan for what you want to build. Using the project proposal that you created earlier as a guide, create a detailed plan for how you will implement the core features of your application using the chosen framework. Again you are welcome and even encouraged to use AI tools to help you generate this plan.

If you used [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) or something similar for the project specification then you can continue with it to now produce the implementation plan and task list. Make sure to specify the technology stack that you are using so that it can generate the appropriate details. Also make sure to stress that you are shooting for a prototype initially.

>Our primary goal is to build a working prototype that demonstrates the core features of our application. We only have two weeks and so AI generation of code can save us a lot of time.
>
>We have a secondary goal of learning the chosen framework as well however. Make sure that you put AI in the backseat for at least one of the features and build it manually (with AI assistance as needed). This will help you to learn the framework better.
>
>Put the AI in "Ask" mode rather than "Agent" node. You could even try creating your own custom mode: "Framework Student" mode where the AI focuses on teaching you the framework as you build. To do this in VS Code with GitHub Copilot:
>1. Make sure that you have a `.github` folder in the root of your project. 
>2. Add a file called `agents/FrameworkStudent.agent.md` with the following content:
>   ```
>   ---
>description: Agent that helps users learn new software frameworks by guiding them through building applications step by step.
>tools:
>  [
>    "read/problems",
>    "read/readFile",
>    "read/terminalSelection",
>    "read/terminalLastCommand",
>    "search",
>    "web/fetch"
>  ]

># Framework Student Mode
>
>You are an expert software developer and teacher. Your goal is to help the user learn a new framework by guiding them through the process of building an application step by step. Focus on explaining concepts clearly and providing code examples that illustrate best practices for the chosen framework.
>When the user asks a question or requests help with a specific task, follow these steps:
>
>1. **Understand the User's Goal**: Clarify what the user wants to achieve with the framework. Ask questions if necessary to get a clear picture of their objectives.
>2. **Break Down the Task**: Divide the overall goal into smaller, manageable tasks or milestones. This helps the user see the progression and understand each part of the framework.
>3. **Provide Explanations and Examples**: For each task, explain the relevant concepts, components, or APIs of the framework. Provide code snippets that demonstrate how to implement the task effectively.
>4. **Encourage Hands-On Learning**: Prompt the user to try out the code examples and experiment with modifications. Encourage them to ask questions about any difficulties they encounter.
>5. **Review and Reflect**: After the user completes a task, review their work together. Provide feedback, suggest improvements, and discuss how the task fits into the larger context of the framework.
>   ``` 
>3. When you are ready to start building, set the chat mode to "Framework Student" mode.
>
>**Note** After switching to this custom Agent mode if you find that the AI is being too helpful and providing the code for you, try asking it something like this: "can you show the instructions you are supposed to follow according to the FrameworkStudent agent?" This should remind it of its role and also validate that your custom Agent file is being read correctly. 

## **03** Submit

You will be asked to complete an evaluation form that will gather information that will help us to eventually decide which technology stack to use for the final project. You will also be asked to reflect on your experience using the chosen framework and any challenges or successes that you encountered during the development process.
