## Introduction

You will be working with a team of 3-4 students for both of the major assignments for this course. This activity will have each team run through a few exercises to help them to get to know each other, and set some ground rules for how the team will operate. Spending this time now can save lots of time and frustration throughout the semester.

## **01** Meet your teammates

After forming your team, spend some time learning a little about each other. Here is a list of questions to get you started:

- What is your name?
- Where are you from?
- What are your interests?
- What is your favorite programming language?
- What do you hope to get out of this course?
- What has your experience with teamwork been in the past?
- What are your strengths and weaknesses?
- What can we do to make this team work well?
- What is the best way to communicate with you?
- What are your concerns about this course?

## **02** Team Management

Review the following article and discuss together: [Making Teams Work](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/team-work/).

Your team should use Github to manage your code. You will create the first shared repository for the course in the first Team activity. You can however get a few other things done to prepare:

1. Agree how the team will communicate with each other, and exchange any info required to make that work. There will be team in MS Teams setup for the course. Talk to the instructor if you would like a channel for your team there. Whether you are using Teams or some other method for communicating you should also establish _how often_ team members are expected to check in.
2. For managing the tracking and assignment of tasks we will be using a tool called [Trello](https://trello.com). Each person should create a free account. We will be using a Trello board to manage the team project. One person in the team should visit this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/KsrYWMaY/sleepoutsidev2), and [copy](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards) it to their account. Then that person should invite the other team members to the board so they can edit it.
3. Discuss how you would like to work together. Will you use a peer programming model or work more independently?
4. Finally discuss what potential issues might arise in the team and discuss ways of addressing those concerns.

## **03** Select a Project

Starting in week 9 we will begin working on a project of the team's choosing. Each member of the class was required to produce a project specification for an idea. Choose one of these ideas for the entire team to finish over the rest of the semester.

As you consider the list of projects keep the following in mind:

1. Your interests and passions
2. The requirements of the project
3. Your team's strengths and weaknesses
4. The time it will take to complete the project
5. The potential for learning and growth
6. The potential for fun and enjoyment
7. Data/API availability
8. Complexity of the project
9. The [Team Project Requirements](../../prove/team-project-final)

Next week we will review the results of the bakeoffs and pick a stack to build the project in. This week we are only picking the project idea.

## Submission

Submit the following in Ilearn:

1. The names of the team members (you can give a team name as well if you would like)
2. The project idea you have chosen.
3. A brief description of how you plan to work together as a team including your communication plan.
