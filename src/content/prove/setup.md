## **01** Check to make sure you have git installed.

Begin by opening up a command prompt for your operating system. The easiest way to do this would be to open VS Code and open a terminal (ctrl + ~). Enter the following:

```bash
 git
```

You should see some instructions as a result. If you see an error then follow [these git installation instructions](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/hosting-git-gihub/ponder1/)

## **02** Install NodeJs

Next, we need to install NodeJs. NodeJs is a runtime environment that will allow us to run tools that will help us with our development.

Follow the instructions for your operating system found here: [Node Installation](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/node-installation/)
