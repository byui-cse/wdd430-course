## Core Requirements

### **01** Code Editor

It is important that you have a good code editor and that you spend some time learning how to use it. For this course it is recommended that you use the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor. Download and install it now if you do not have it.

I would also recommend reviewing [the documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) if you have not.

### **02** Node/NPM

Have each member of the team install the current LTS (Long Term Support) version of node. Follow the instructions for your operating system found in this [Node setup page](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/node-installation/).

Make sure that you are familiar with how to use the command prompt for your operating system. Here are some quickstarts for the [command line for Mac](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/cli-basics/prepare1/) and the [command line for Windows](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/cli-basics/prepare1/) if you need a review.

### **03** Git and GitHub

Each person should also have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and have an account at [GitHub](https://github.com).

You can tell whether you already have Git by opening a terminal (Mac) or CMD prompt/Powershell (Windows) and typing `git --version`. If you get an error, you need to install it.

### **04** Github Education

Apply for [Github Education](https://github.com/settings/education/benefits?locale=en-US) to get access to Copilot Pro. The account you apply on has to have your byui.edu email address affiliated with it. If you have another account that you are already using you can add the Byui email as a second address in your [profile email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails). Or you could create another Github account with the school email address.

It takes three days after your application is approved for the benefits to kick in. After those 72 hours have passed you can enable Copilot Pro for no charge.

### **05** Microsoft Teams

A Microsoft Team has been setup for this course, and you should have been added to it. Download [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app) and sign in with your university account. You should see a team named `WDD430.x semester` (If it were Fall 2020, and you are in section 1 the name would be `WDD430.01 F20`). Post a message in the General channel indicating that you are in.
