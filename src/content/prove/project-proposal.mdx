## Overview

Each person in the class should produce a specification for a team project. This specification will be used in Unit two as a way to explore different technologies and stacks in a Bakeoff format. Later in the course, teams will be formed based on the results of the bakeoffs and the specifications submitted here.

Our goal with the Bakeoffs is to determine which stack and technologies will be best suited for your project. As we only have two weeks for each bakeoff, it is important that we start with a clear plan for what we want to build.

This plan however should not be overly prescriptive. The plan should not mention implementation details like technologies or stacks. The goal is to have a clear idea of what we want to build, but also to leave room for exploration and learning.

## Objectives

- Apply full-stack development skills in a collaborative environment
- Design and implement a structured, maintainable web application
- Demonstrate the ability to work with databases, APIs, and UI/UX design
- Practice agile workflows and development best practices

## Technical Requirements

TBD based on the proposals submitted by the class. However, the following general requirements will apply to all projects:

## Minimum Features & Functionality

Your application must include:

- A clear user purpose or problem it solves. This does not have to be unique, but it should be well-defined. You might even solve a problem that already has existing solutions. For example, what would you change if you were to build a social media app, a Learning Management System, or a retail storefront?
- Several distinct user interfaces or views
- Users and Authentication (e.g., sign up, login, profile management)
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for at least two different data models
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- A project README that includes:
    - Project description
    - Team members
    - Setup and installation instructions
    - API documentation
    - Known issues or future improvements

## Team Workflow Requirements

- Use Git and GitHub for version control
- Use a project management tool (e.g., Trello, Asana, Jira) to track progress
- Each team member must make regular, meaningful contributions
- Follow basic agile practices:
    - Weekly sprint goals
    - Short planning/retrospective notes (can be documented in GitHub issues or a shared doc)

## **01** Specification

Prepare a specification to present to the instructor. Your specification should be detailed enough that someone unfamiliar with the project could still build it with few questions. Some of the information that should be there includes:

1. A description of your project
2. Your target audience or users
3. A list of the core features you will implement for an MVP.
4. A list of additional features you will implement.
5. Wireframes or mockups of the user interface
6. Your initial data models
7. A list of the API endpoints you will need to implement

>Many of the things in this proposal could change as you start implementation. This is ok. You will be able to change your mind about some of these things later on. The important thing is to have a solid plan in place before you start coding.

## **02** AI Generation

Because of the level of detail required in this specification you are encouraged to use AI tools to help you generate some of the content. You can use AI to help you brainstorm ideas, generate wireframes, and even create initial data models. However you should carefully review and edit any content generated by AI to ensure it meets your needs and is accurate.

A tool like [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) may be helpful in generating some of the content for this proposal. Here is a [spec kit quickstart](../../ponder/spec-driven) to get you started. Or you can use this [project template]() for a different approach. 

If you end up using Spec-kit then you only want to complete the first part for this assignment. Then during the bakeoff unit you will have it produce the implementation details and tasks based on your chosen stacks.

## **03** Submit

As soon as you have this plan completed submit it!
