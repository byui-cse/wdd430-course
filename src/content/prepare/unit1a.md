> ### Tips
>
>- Read for understanding, not completion. This means that some weeks when the concepts settle quickly in your mind you will fly through the reading. Other weeks you might have to read several times...and spend lots of time working through the code examples until you understand. You may even need to go find a few extra sources on your own for some topics.
>- Don't skip the code examples! Make sure to spend time reviewing these. With the book we are using you can actually interact with the code samples directly. If you have time you should also work through the exercises at the end of each chapter.
>- Take good notes! One of the most important things that you can include in your notes are questions that arise in your mind as you read. Having this list will help you to know what topics need more time, and will give you something to say when the instructor asks: "Do you have any questions from the reading?"
