## Introduction

When attempting to solve larger and more complex problems with AI, the biggest challenge ends up keeping the AI focused. It often forgets what it was supposed to be doing, and as a result goes on random tangents: "Hallucinations".

Giving AI a very detailed roadmap of what it is supposed to be building can help with it's focus. AI knows a lot about application structure and planning it turns out, and so it can actually be of great help to us in developing these detailed specification that we will later use to keep the AI on track.

## **01** Specification

For this activity we will be using [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) to help us generate a detailed specification for a web application.
Spec-Kit is a tool built by GitHub that uses AI to help you create detailed specifications for software projects. It can generate user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical requirements based on your project idea.

You are welcome to install and use Spec-Kit locally if you wish by following the instructions in the ReadMe. However for this activity I recommend downloading one of the [spec kit templates](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/releases/tag/v0.0.90). For most of you the copilot powered version will be the best choice. Choose `copilot-sh` if you are aon a Unix based system (Mac/Linux) or `copilot-ps` if you are on Windows.

Open the downloaded template in VS Code and follow the instructions in the ReadMe to get started.

1. Choose a web application idea that you would like to create a specification for. 
2. Make sure that Github Copilot is enabled in your VS Code. Open the Chat window.
3. Establish the project principles by building a constitution for your project by running the script provided by spec Kit. For Example:
```text
/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements
```
4. Next create a detailed project specification by running the spec kit script again. For Example:
```text
/speckit.spec Create a detailed project specification for a web application that allows users to create and share notes. The application should include user authentication, note creation and editing, and note sharing features
```
5. Review the generated specification and make any necessary edits or additions to ensure that it accurately reflects your project idea. Make sure to review the **entire** specification including the technical requirements and acceptance criteria.
6. Don't be afraid to have the AI regenerate sections that you are not happy with. You can also manually edit any sections that need improvement.
7. Save your completed specification for future reference.

You will notice that there are more steps in the ReadMe for Spec-Kit. The next step would be to generate an implementation plan from the specification you just created. However we will save that for a future activity. For that step we need to start thinking about technology stacks and frameworks to use which we are not ready for yet.

## **02** Implementation Plan

In a future activity we will take the specification that you created in this activity and use it to generate an implementation plan and task list for building the application. This will help us (and AI) to stay focused and on track as we build out our application. Here is a summary of how to do that when we are ready:

1. Choose the technology stack that you will be using to build your application. This should include the front-end framework, back-end framework, database, and any other tools or libraries that you plan to use.
2. Use the spec-kit script to generate an implementation plan based on your project specification and chosen technology stack. For Example:
```text
/speckit.plan Create an implementation plan for the project specification using the following technology stack:
- Front-end: React
- Back-end: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB
```
3. Review the generated implementation plan and make any necessary edits or additions to ensure that it accurately reflects your project idea and chosen technology stack.
4. Use the implementation plan to then create a list of tasks that need to be completed in order to build the application. This can also be done using the spec-kit script. Make sure that you provide the specification file and implementation plan as context to the AI! For Example:
```text
/speckit.tasks 
```
5. Review the generated task list and make any necessary edits or additions to ensure that it accurately reflects the work that needs to be done to build the application.
6. Once you have a task list you are happy with you can start working through the tasks one by one to build out your application, or have AI help you with the implementation of each task while you review and test the results.
```text
/speckit.implement
```

When you use AI in this way to generate larger pieces of code it is important to always review and test the results. AI can make mistakes and generate code that does not work as expected. Always make sure to test the generated code thoroughly before moving on to the next task. Your time as a developer switches from writing code to reviewing code. Don't get lazy with this step! One it will help you learn, and two it will help you catch mistakes before they become bigger problems later on.
