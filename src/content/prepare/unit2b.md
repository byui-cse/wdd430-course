## Topics

Each week there is an expectation that the student will do some additional research on a topic relevant to the course. Here is an incomplete list of topics to get you started:

- Web performance
- Web architectures
- Emerging web techologies or platforms
- Information about advantages and disadvantages of different platforms
- Information about identifying the right tool for the job.
- Information that helped you solve a problem you were working on this week in your code or otherwise.
- ...etc

Submit an article or video that you found that you believe relates to one of the topics in the course. Include a brief summary as well as any questions it either answered or posed for you. These will be used to frame discussions in class.
