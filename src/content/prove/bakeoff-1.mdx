## Overview

Now that you have put together a detailed specification for a project idea it's time to start building! In this first bakeoff you and your team will implement the core features of your project using one of the technology stacks that you have researched so far. The goal of this bakeoff is to get a working prototype of your application up and running so that you can start testing and iterating on it.

## Objectives

- Explore Full stack technologies
- Learn how to measure and compare different technology stacks
- Build a working prototype of your project idea


## Technical Requirements

For this bakeoff we will explore what are currently being called "Meta Frameworks". These are frameworks that provide a full stack solution for building web applications. Some examples of these include:
- Next.js
- TanStack
- Remix
- SvelteKit
- Nuxt.js
- Astro (when used with server-side rendering)

Your database can be anything you are comfortable with. You can use a traditional SQL database like PostgreSQL, MySQL or Supabase, or you can use a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Firebase. You can also use an in-memory database like Redis if that fits your project needs.

## Minimum Features & Functionality

Our goal is to build a minimum viable product (MVP) or prototype that includes the core features of your project idea. At a minimum your application should include:
- User authentication (sign up, log in, log out)
- A main feature that is the core of your project idea (e.g., posting content, commenting, liking, etc.)
- A responsive user interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Basic error handling and validation


## **01** Research

Pick a Meta framework that you are interested in exploring. Find a tutorial or guide that will help you get started with building a simple application using that framework. 

## **02** AI Generation

We only have two weeks to complete this bakeoff so it's important to have a clear plan for what you want to build. Using the project proposal that you created earlier as a guide, create a detailed plan for how you will implement the core features of your application using the chosen framework. Again you are welcom and even encouraged to use AI tools to help you generate this plan.

If you used [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) or something similar for the project specification then you can continue with it to now produce the implementation plan and task list. Make sure to specify the technology stack that you are using so that it can generate the appropriate details. Also make sure to stress that you are shooting for a prototype initially.

## **03** Submit

You will be asked to complete an evaluation form that will gather information that will help us to eventually decide which technology stack to use for the final project. You will also be asked to reflect on your experience using the chosen framework and any challenges or successes that you encountered during the development process.
